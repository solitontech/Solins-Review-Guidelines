Python Best practices

Naming Conventions
•	Avoid single-character names like j , c
•	Use short, lowercase names. Underscores if needed
•	Use PascalCase for class names
•	Use PascalCase with z suffix (e.g., contextmanager T ).
•	Use PascalCase with Error suffix.
•	Use snake_case for variables and functions
•	Prefix non-public with _ , and use _ for name mangling.
•	Use UPPER_CASE for constants

Programming Recommendations Boolean & None Checks
•	Use is None / is not None for none checks
•	Use if cond: / if not cond , We don't have to compare with True or False. Check for true —> if A: , false -> if not A:
•	Use if not seq: for empty sequences.

Exception Handling
•	Be specific. Avoid bare except:
•	Use try -except for expected errors only. Do error handling with known errors and raise some custom exceptions if needed.
•	Always think of fail cases and proper error messages — app shouldn‘t break
•	Use with or finally to manage resources

Code Documentation
•	Document the application setup, features in README
•	Comments for implementation details.
•	Write meaningful docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions
•	Prefer clean, readable code over excessive commenting
•	Remove unused params from docs

Code Structure and Design

Modularity & Readability
•	The code should be readable, modular and scalable
    o Adhere SOLID principles
    o Identifiers should be meaningful
    o All functions should be strongly typed
•	Keep functions short, focused and testable functions
•	One purpose per function
•	identifiers (variables, class or function names etc) should be named meaningfully and should be easily understandable to a developer who is not familiar with the codebase
•	Organize related functions/classes logically
•	Separate concerns using modules and packages
•	Avoid deep nesting
•	Use blank lines to separate logical blocks and this will improve readablity
•	Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
•	Limit lines to 79-80 characters
•	Use 4-space indentation
•	Avoid overly clever or compressed code
•	Avoid complex syntax
•	Proper branch naming
•	Have some default values in a separate file
•	Remove unused code wherever not used to ensure maintainability
•	Stick with single quote or double quote for strings
•	This indentation should be good — keep line length per PEP or use new lines per argument
•	Use keyword arguments to improve code readability.
•   Use spell checker extension

Efficiency & Optimization
•	The code should be well optimized
    o	Use efficient data structures and algorithms
    o   Optimize memory (e.g., yield )
    o	Use concurrency/parallels where applicable
    o   Use caching for API responses
•	Use list comprehensions
•	Use generators for large data
•	Avoid unnecessary memory usage with some objects like client connections
•	Use enunenate() instead of range(ien(...))
•	Use zip() to iterate multiple sequences
•	Use tuple unpacking ( a, b = b, a )
•	while building APIs response time in crucial, efficient caching must be used without bloating the memory, possible things need to be pre computed on server start.
•	If any two I/O bound tasks can be executed concurrently, should be executed concurrently.
•	If any two intense compuations can be executed parallely, should be decided to execute parallely or not considering the time to spawn new process

Immutability
•	Use tuples, mapping proxy, frozenset, frozen pydantic models where applicable.

Pydantic Usage
•	Strong validations with @field_validator, @model_validator

Resource & Import Handling
•	Use with statement for resource management
•	Avoid using import *
•	Always use named arguments
•	Remove unused imports
•	Group imports: standard — third-party — local
•	Have order for import statements: in-built — installed — project modules
•	Specified package should be present in poetry

Function Design
•	All functions including private functions should be strongly typed
•	Add type hints and default parameters if applicable
•	Use done as return type hint when applicable
•	Define positional arguments first, then optional
•	Avoid too many parameters
•	Use early returns to reduce nesting

Testing
•	Test cases should include expected behaviour, error handling, and corner cases
•	Write unit tests for critical paths
•	Use fixtures for setup/teardown
•   Use parametrizations
•	Tests should be readable and maintainable
•	Mock external systems

Logging & Debugging
•	Give meaningful error in user end, as we don't need these detailed errors, but we need the original error logged with full trace, use logger.exception
•	Configure log level with DEBUG as default, so developer can easily debug in development and use logger to log errors.
•	If FastAPI server, run in DEBUG (reload)
•	Have good log messages

Environment & Setup
•	Add default env in .env.example wherever applicable
•	Avoid quotes and spaces in env to compatible with docker env
•	Add Dockerfile and docker-compose for easy setup in developer end

Code Formatting & Style
•	Use auto code formatters
•	Triple quotes are for multiline comments — avoid them for short ones
•	Make small (atomic) commits whenever possible
